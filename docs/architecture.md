MonOSS should not be a very complicated software fundamentally.

Store motes and relationships in SQLite database(s). Use Python commands to update those databases.

The user should be able to use a simple UI to view and interact with the graph. The user should also be able to interact with the graph through a CLI.

# Motes

Store motes by immutable ID. Properties of motes should be an extremely flexible datatype that isn’t stored directly in the database.

# Relationships

Store relationships by immutable ID. 

Relationships should have the ability to modify the properties of motes programmatically. This is an advanced feature that should be finished later in development. Consult the human for more advice when implementing the simulation capabilities.

# Gardens

The user should be able to create multiple object graphs that are completely separate from each other. These are called gardens.

# Species

A mote can act as a "species" -- a shared type that other motes are declared instances of. A species is still just a mote; nothing marks it as special structurally. Membership is a relationship: a mote is an instance of a species by having an `instance_of` relationship pointing at it. `instance_of` is a reserved relationship type recognized by the engine and UI, the same way any type system needs some minimal way to express "is-a."

Species are flat for now -- a species being an instance of another species is not interpreted as inheritance. A mote may be an instance of more than one species. In v1, species only matter as a way to target rules at every instance of a type at once (e.g. "this rule applies to every instance of Resistor"); enforcing required or default properties per species (e.g. every instance of Person must have `age` and `phone_number`) is a deferred extension, not built yet.
